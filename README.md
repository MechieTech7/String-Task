# String-Task
String is basically defined as Sequence of characters.
Java String
In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. 


Basic Program for Java string length:
-In this program, we need to count the number of characters present in the string

Algorithm code:
- Import the scanner as we gonna use scanner inside the program.
- Initially declare the class as public so that we can access it from anywhere and name the class.
- We declare access modifier so that the code develops further.
- Now we want to get input from the user.
- As we gets that from user, need to print the length so we want to use .nextline so that it develops fully.
- Now it displays required result.

Now im doing another program to compare two strings from user input:
-From the above program we learnt that how to calculate the length of a string from user input.
-Now as of same from above, we do get inputs from user and gonna comparing it.

Algorithm code:
- Import the scanner as we gonna use scanner inside the program.
- Initially  declare it as public so that we can access.
- Now we want to get inputs from the user.
- After getting that strings from users,we gonna compare its length.
- If it equals then it displays str1 equal str2
- If str1 is greater or lesser than str2 , it displays the result.
